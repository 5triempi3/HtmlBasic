    <h3>Your donation can help save an animal!</h2><br><br>
      <p>Animals enrich our lives in so many ways. They give us joy, protection, companionship,
        and unconditional love. Our tough economic times mean less money but more animals in need of help.
        Your wonderful support will ensure the ongoing care of the animals at the Sandton SPCA and also
        help us to provide basic education, treatment, rescue and sterilisation work undertaken by us on a daily basis.<br><br>

        Without donations from the public, A Pet For Your Home is not able to sustain its activities. No donation should be regarded as too big or too small.<br><br>

        We would like you to know that not only will your donation directly benefit the animals in our area but –
        through a sharing agreement between all A Pet For Your Home nationwide – a portion will be used in other, less fortunate areas to benefit animals over a wider area.
        We feel sure you will approve of this outreach initiative and wish to thank you most sincerely for supporting our A Pet For Your Home and the movement generally.</p><br><br>
