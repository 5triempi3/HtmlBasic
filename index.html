            <p> This is Remy and his new owner Lauren. <br>
              Since birth he was a very sick dog with a very low white cell count, his owners didn't want him so they abandoned him. <br>
              No one ever wanted to adopt him because they didn't want a dog that could get sick easily <br>
              But Lauren was up for the challenge, and with the help of the shelter he is a healthy and happy dog. Remy is loving his new home with Lauren.</p>
